RISC-V is not yet officially supported in Kubernetes, but to let you test this technology with Kube containers, we have prepared an image with the necessary pre-built binaries.

Thanks to Scaleway Kosmos and our Elastic Metal RV1, you can follow this guide to launch RISC-V containers on Kubernetes effortlessly and in just a few minutes.

1. [Install the server](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/bare-metal/elastic-metal/how-to/install-server/) with the `Kosmos` image.
2. Go to the **Nodes** tab of your Kosmos cluster and click **Add external node**.
3. Do not follow the instructions on the page to connect your server into the pool.  
Note only the `POOL_ID` and `POOL_REGION`.

4. Create a Scaleway secret key with the `KubernetesExternalNodeRegister` IAM permission set. [How to create a secret key](https://www.scaleway.com/docs/console/my-project/how-to/generate-api-key/).
5. Connect via SSH to your Elastic Metal RV1 server.
6. Export noted env variables and secret key.

    ```
    export POOL_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    export POOL_REGION=xx-xxx
    export SCW_SECRET_KEY=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

8. Run node agent.

    `sudo -E ./node-agent_linux_riscv64 -loglevel 0 -no-controller && sleep 10`

9. **Restart** your server.
